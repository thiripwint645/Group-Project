              Mandalay is also known as the center of Burmese traditional arts
              and culture. The magnificent structure is considered as the
              longest teakwood bridge built by man which is known as U Bein
              Bridge that has a length of 1.2 km . Mandalay hill provides a
              bird’s eye view of Mandalay City and one can see far into the
              horizon during the clear days ,the best time to visit is during
              the sunset, which is around from 5:00 pm to 5:30 pm in the
              afternoon (also known as “the Golden Hour”).The Mandalay Fort and
              Moat still serve as the soul of Mandalay city.

            <p>
              My next stop then was Mandalay, which is the former royal capital
              of Myanmar and located in the north of the country. It has a lot
              of beautiful sights, like the royal palace but also different
              pagodas and monasteries. I really enjoyed the view over the city
              from Mandalay and was also very impressed by the World’s Largest
              Book, the Kuthodaw Pagoda. This book is presented in 729 white
              marble shrines which contain one slab inscribed on both sides
              each. Another popular and beautiful site is the U-Bein bridge, the
              longest teak footbridge located in Amarapura, which is especially
              beautiful during the sunset times.

            <p>
              If you are looking for daytrips from Yangon, you should think
              about going to the Golden Rock (Kyaiktiyo Pagoda). This is a
              highly visited pilgrimage site in the Mon-state. It is a small
              pagoda that was built on top of a granite boulder that is covered
              in gold leaves. According to a legend the rock can is stabilized
              by Buddhas hair that keeps it from falling down the mountain. I
              was very impressed by the whole experience of visiting the Golden
              Rock, starting with the adventurous truck drive up the mountain
              and then discovering that there is a proper village on the
              mountain with markets and restaurants.

              Myanmar. It is joined with Thailand to a relatively slender length
              of land .You can take express bus from Yangon to Dawei since Dawei
              is accessible by land. To reach Myeik, you must fly from Yangon,

              culture and traditions from Myanmar and Thailand , but we should
              go to the Mgmakan Beach where u can enjoy nice and beautiful sea
